### Join us for our upcoming seminars

#### February 24, 2022 · 15:00-16:00 (CET)

**Different drug targets require different computational approaches**<br />
**Ariane Nunes Alves** (TU Berlin/UniSysCat, Berlin) & **David Machalz** (Nuvisan ICB GmbH, Berlin)<br />

It is well-known that the structure of protein binding pockets strongly influences small-molecule ligand binding. The peculiarity of many proteins or protein families, however, often demands a tailored approach. This is particularly in cases where key information is missing in well-studied targets or where the natural ligand is unknown or poorly characterized, such as in ‘orphaned’ proteins.

**Ariane Nunes Alves** presents a structural rationale for kinetic selectivity between two closely related kinases, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2). Molecular dynamics simulations, in combination with τ-Random Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (τ-RAMD), were used to characterize inhibitor-kinase residence times. Simulation data, which was well-correlated by experiment, was used to explain why some inhibitors have long  residence times when bound to FAK, but not when bound to PYK2, and revealed mechanistic insights of factors modulating residence times. This has implications for the design of inhibitors for both proteins where inhibition of FAK is insufficient to prevent signaling due to the compensatory activity of PYK2. 

Drug-metabolism related cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) have been extensively studied. However, other CYPs remain under-studied, such as the case in a promising breast cancer target, CYP4Z1. This enzyme is over-expressed in breast cancers and correlated with tumor progression but is not yet addressed by potent small molecule inhibitors. **David Machalz** and collaborators used an in silico/in vitro structure-based design pipeline to discover a potent inhibitor of the orphaned CYP4Z1, combining modeling and mutagenesis studies followed by a virtual screening campaign. Screening hits were confirmed by experiment, including the drug ozagrel and a new inhibitor, the binding of the latter rationalized by quantum chemistry and extensive molecular dynamics simulations. This new pharmacological tool will benefit future studies on the physiological and pathophysiological role of CYP4Z1, leading to new therapeutic approaches in targeting the enzyme.

**Deciphering interaction profiles with molecular dynamics simulations**<br />
**Guillermo Pérez Hernández** (Charité, Berlin) & **Tim Hempel** (FU, Berlin)<br />
Molecular Dynamics (MD) is an established simulation method that yields atomic-level detail, giving insights into molecular processes at arbitrary time resolutions. Abstracting useful information from MD simulations, however, is a different story, in particular for drug development.
<i>Guillermo</i>: Molecular structures <i>in motion</i> tell a story that is sometimes hard to understand. From visual inspection to highly automated statistical analysis, different approaches yield different types of information. When are atomic-level details relevant, when are they anecdotal? Are we better off with ensembles and/or macrostates? Do simple correlations suffice? When do we use existing tools and when do we adapt new ones? I will try to provide some answers to these questions by presenting some work on different GPCR-systems.
<i>Tim</i>: In an effort to re-purpose approved drugs against COVID, we investigate the molecular inhibition mechanism of TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activator. Through molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modeling, the binding process of the drugs camostat and nafamostat to TMPRSS2 is described in atomistic detail. We find that nafamostat has a higher Michaelis complex population than camostat, explaining the potency differences measured in our in-vitro assays. This mechanistic understanding is used to suggest a novel drug combination with late stage drug candidate otamixaban.

**Development and application of high throughput screening**<br />
**Saif Mohd** (MDC, Berlin) & **Theresa Melder** (MDC, Berlin)<br />
Saif is working on dynamin superfamily of proteins with focus on EHDs. This family consists of mechano-chemical proteins driven by GTP/ATP hydrolysis. His aim is to find inhibitor molecules via high throughput screening and to characterize them structurally and functionally.
Teresa develops a novel proteomic screening platform to explore the target landscape of bioactive compounds. Using unspecific UV-X-linking, drug-like substances are immobilized simultanously on functionalized cellulose membranes in an undirected manner and without any prior modification of the compounds being required. The constructed drug microarray is used to pull down interacting proteins from a whole cell extract in an affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to identify specific targets.

#### July 15, 2021 (online)
**Computational tools guiding drug discovery for ion channels and kinases**<br />
**David Mauricio Ramírez Sánchez** (Universidad Autónoma de Chile) & **Dominique Sydow** (Charité, Berlin)<br />
This session is getting more computational again! We will discuss computational strategies guiding drug discovery for two important drug targets: ion channels and kinases.
<a href="https://ramirezlab.github.io/index">David Mauricio Ramírez Sánchez</a> will talk about two pore domain TASK channels linked to breast cancer, sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation. 
Guided by the molecular basis of TASK1 and TASK3 channel modulation by known drugs, his group has designed new compounds using pharmacophore-based virtual screening. The best candidates are now optimized using medicinal chemistry.
Dominique Sydow, PhD student from the Volkamer Lab, will show how the structural information of kinase pockets can be encoded computationally and used to understand and predict (dis)similarities in this highly conserved protein class. These similarities can guide polypharmacology, off-target, and repurposing studies. Dominique will also shortly promote the TeachOpenCADD platform for everyone who is interested in learning Python programming in the context of cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics.

**Biomimetic and Stimuli-Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications**<br />
**Daniel Klinger** (FU, Berlin) & **Gregor Fuhrmann** (HIPS, Saarbrücken)<br />
Efficient delivery of therapeutics not only requires (nano)carriers to host and release drugs of often limited solubility, but also to address the complex structures of challenging biological barriers. Since this complexity prevents the utilization of a one-fits-all system, different (colloidal) carrier systems are being tailored to specific therapeutic needs. Among such delivery vehicles, this talk will focus on the potential of synthetic polymeric nanogels (NGs) and natural extracellular vesicles (EVs) as complementary approaches.
Daniel Klinger will present an overview of the research in the Klinger group where they combine different length scales in the synthetic design of stimuli-responsive NGs. He will give examples on how to adjust the carrier properties to deliver insoluble drugs, address challenging bio-barriers (e.g. skin), and target current threats (e.g. antimicrobial resistance). In addition, fundamental investigations to examine the potential of utilizing colloidal shape change as new targeting concept will be discussed.
Gregor Fuhrmann will present some of the recent efforts to better understand the biological role of EVs in infection and inflammation. He will provide an insight into the isolation and characterization of EVs and explain their potential loading with model compounds, from small molecule drugs to larger biomacromolecules. Moreover, he will present recent examples of combining EVs with novel biomaterial development, important foundations for their advanced biomedical development.

**Nanobodies in Structural Biology and Therapy**<br />
**Magdalena Schacherl** (Charité, Berlin) & **Amal Hassan** (Charité, Berlin)<br />
Nanobodies are versatile tools for structural biology and promising next-generation biodrugs. In this seminar, we will hear two talks on how the production and usage of nanobodies can facilitate protein structure determination and drug discovery. First, Magdalena Schacherl will introduce nanobodies and explain their use for structural biology research as well as their potential and application as therapeutics. Second, Amal Hassan will present her complex structure of the specific nanobody Nb11 with Gelsolin (GSN), a soluble protein responsible for a familial degenerative disease (AGel amyloidosis), solved at 1.9 Å resolution. This structural information, together with biochemical and biophysical studies, helped to decipher the pathological mechanism of a GSN disease-mutant.

**Computational Chemistry in Industry**<br />
**Jérémie Mortier** (Bayer, Berlin) & **Floriane Montanari** (Bayer, Berlin)<br />
Computational methods are employed in numerous ways in early drug development. In this seminar, we present two examples of how such methods are applied at Bayer to develop novel drugs. First, Jérémie Mortier will present an early synergistic research project applying computational molecular design to medicinal chemistry, in order to find drugs for KRAS. Since the discovery of the druggable allosteric binding site containing the G12C mutation, KRAS has attracted a lot of attention in oncology research and is now one of the most-studied anticancer targets. In the second talk, Floriane Montanari will explain how pharmacokinetic properties are predicted as part of the routine toolbox at Bayer. She discusses the continuous and reversible representation of compounds as SMILES and the application of deep learning methods to effectively predict physico-chemical properties of compounds in a multitask fashion.

**Mechanistic Insights in GPCR Signal Transduction**<br />
**Martha Sommer** (Charité, Berlin) & **Marcel Bermudez** (FU, Berlin)<br />
The importance of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal transduction research for medicine and human health cannot be overstated. While the field has undergone a revolution of understanding thanks to many technical advancements, GPCR signal transduction as a whole is not fully understood. Notably, potentially misleading paradigms regarding the complexities of GPCR signal transduction must be re-evaluated. In this seminar, we will present two research perspectives on GPCR signal transduction: 1) Ligand-dependent modulation of GPCR activity, including phenomena like partial agonism and biased signaling, and 2) Revisioning how GPCRs recruit, activate and bind their regulatory arrestin proteins. The seminar will conclude with a brief introduction of ERNEST, an EU-funded COST Action (consortium) focused on a holistic understanding of GPCR signal transduction and tackling the unresolved issues in the field.
