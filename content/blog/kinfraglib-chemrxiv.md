We are happy to present the results of our [_KinFragLib_](/projects/kinfraglib/) project. Aiming to explore and extend the chemical space of kinase inhibitors, we propose a novel subpocket-guided fragmentation and recombination strategy. 

Take a look at our [preprint on ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c74e19ee301c3a99c7a431) to find our more: 
"KinFragLib: Exploring the kinase inhibitor space using subpocket-focused fragmentation and recombination". You can find the reported fragment and combinatorial libraries including all analyses notebooks on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/volkamerlab/KinFragLib).

Thanks to all co-authors for working together on this project with such enthusiasm: {{< person "dominique.sydow" >}}, {{< person "paula.schmiel" >}}, {{< person "jeremie.mortier" >}}, and {{< person "andrea.volkamer" >}}.
