## Digidrug

First up, on **Thu 17. February 2022, 4pm - 5:30pm CET** the next episode of the virtual seminar series, [Digital Science for Drug Discovery](http://www.digidrug.net/) will be held. 

Focused on the Berlin region, the series aims to facilitate and enmesh relationships between researchers working within both academia and industry. The over-arching theme? Making efficient and creative use of the wealth of available and growing chemical and biological data combined with powerful computational means at our disposal.

Confirmed speakers for the next series include: 

* [Dr. Floriane Montanari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/floriane-montanari-3577091b) (Bayer) - **"An Introduction to Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Small Molecules"**
* [Assist.-Prof. Mag. Dr. Günter Klambauer](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-machine-learning/ueber-uns/team/assist-prof-mag-dr-guenter-klambauer/) (Johannes Kepler Universität Linz) **"Deep Learning Methods for Chemical Reactivity"**

Registration is open via Zoom: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0uduysrzksE9EuD4PXg3QzQmY1rI_SxSmc

Confirmed speakers for the next series include:

* [Dr. Ariane Nunes](https://www.unisyscat.de/people/nunes-alves-ariane.html) (TU Berlin/UniSysCat, Berlin) **"Protein-ligand binding kinetics in drug design: prediction of kinetic rates for kinases"**
* [Dr. David Machalz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-machalz/) (Nuvisan ICB GmbH, Berlin)) **"Discovery of a potent inhibitor of human CYP4Z1 through mechanistic in-silico modeling"**
